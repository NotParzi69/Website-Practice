        <p class="paragraph">     Hello, my name is Bryce Donston. I am currently on my summer break and have decided to 
            learn front-end development and see what is can do with a skill like coding. At first I was using sites
             like free code camp that was really boring and tedious. I then moved onto The Odin Project a website that not only taught you how to code. 
             But also the different environments and tools that are used.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"> In the beginning of The Odin Project it focused on Git,Github and the terminal. 
            All things that are very easy for anyone(even me) to do. Then is moved onto html and css. 
            Html wasnt super difficult and i was able to get through that fairly easily. But CSS through 
            me through a loop with style sheets and manipulating the code made in html. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
                At the moment, I am a little confuse on the box model and how that all works. But, 
            I think I will be able to work through it and improve as a developer! </p>
